# LIRI NODE APP

## Overview

In this project, I made LIRI. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI is a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives back data.

For this project, LIRI displays my latest tweets. To retrieve the data that will power the app, I sent requests to the Twitter, Spotify and IMDB APIs. These Node packages are crucial for the project.

  * Twitter
  * Spotify
  * Request (Request is used to grab data from the OMDB API).

# Procedure

* Make a new GitHub repository called liri-node-app and clone it to the local computer.
